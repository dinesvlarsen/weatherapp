# Weather app
A simple weather app using [https://goweather.herokuapp.com](https://goweather.herokuapp.com). 
The api is a bit unreliable, as in it doesn't work sometimes and I'm pretty sure it doesn't display accurate temperatures. But since it was mostly made for educational purposes I don't really ming.

I tried to implement a cool clothing tip depending on what temperature it is, got the clothing suggestions from [this place](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2018/10/30/weather-is-what-you-wear-unpacking-clothing-connected-different-climate-conditions-united-states/).

Not sure how accurate it is, so do take the advice with a grain of salt!

## How to run on your local machine
